# What is Git?

**Git** is a tool used by developers to **track versions of code and files**.  

Think of it like working on a document:  
- Every time you make changes, you save a new version (`file_v1`, `file_v2`, `final_file`, etc.).  
- This quickly becomes messy.  

Git solves this problem by:  
- âœ… Automatically saving each change as a **version**  
- âœ… Allowing you to **check old versions** anytime  
- âœ… Letting you **undo mistakes** easily  
- âœ… Helping multiple people work on the same project by **merging changes**  

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Git is like a time machine + teamwork tool for code and files.**
